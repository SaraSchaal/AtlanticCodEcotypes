Edited output file from sequencer with number of samples. 
The last column shows the extra Mb we have over the 15x expection. 
Any negative values (highlighted in yellow) mean we didnâ€™t get enough coverage to have at least 15x for the number of 
samples with that index combination. There are only three of those and assuming even coverage across samples within indexes 
we have a minimum of ~13x coverage for all the samples. We also got an extra ~200,000 Mb of data off the sequencer than what 
we were quoted (table on bottom of document).
