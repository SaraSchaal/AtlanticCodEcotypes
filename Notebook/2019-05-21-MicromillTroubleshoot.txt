20190521 - Otolith Micromill Troubleshooting Notes

* Otoliths are consistently breaking when we mill 
* There otoliths do not or break a small bit
* TESTED: set one of my otoliths in their epoxy but it still broke
* NEXT STEP: Zach is setting and cutting a fresh otolith of theirs to see if it is the otoliths or the machine post fixing
* MY NEXT STEP: Setting one of their otoliths in my epoxy using the same method I have been using and setting another one in epoxy that has the bubbles removed via vacuum (Ries Lab)
