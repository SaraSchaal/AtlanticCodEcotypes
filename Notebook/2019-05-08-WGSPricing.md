We have decided to switch from EecSeq to WGS for my project.
NovaSeq S4 flow cell. Turnaround time – 5 – 7 business days. (10x coverage based on 613 Mbp)

| Service                                       | Unit cost   | Quantity | Subtotal    | 
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|-------------| 
| Quantitation and cluster generation           | $24         | 1        | $24.00      | 
| Illumina NovaSeq sequencing, S4, per flowcell | $24,000     | 1        | $24,000.00  | 
| Data delivery by hard drive                   | $600.00     |          | $600.00     | 
| **Estimated Total for Project:**               |             |          | **$24,624.00**  | 
| **Estimated Price Per Sample: **                 |             |          | **$24,624.00**  | 


NEXT STEPS: Outline plan for doing tests before sending for sequencing (verify with Genewiz that our adapters/primers will work)
 - Ideas from Katie include:
    * Tapestation
    * Qpcr
    * HiSeq some samples
